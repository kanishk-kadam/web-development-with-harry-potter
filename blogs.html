        <h2>HEADMASTER</h2>
        <p>He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 1945 until 1997, and considered by many as the greatest Hogwarts Headmaster. As he was about to die by a cursed ring, Dumbledore planned his own death with Severus Snape. ... Dumbledore is the only Headmaster who was laid to rest at Hogwarts.</p>
          <p>  Loyalty: Dumbledore family,Gellert Grindelwald </p>
           <p> Occupation: Professor of Defence Against the dark art</p>

        <h2>HEAD OF GRIFFINDORE</h2>
        <p>She was born in 1935, graduated in 1954, and worked at the Ministry two years after graduation before asking Dumbledore to work as a professor at the school. If this timeline is canon, then McGonagall definitely would have taught James and Lily as they were at Hogwarts during the 70s.</p>
